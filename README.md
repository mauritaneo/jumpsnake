# mauritaneo's Jump Snake
Funny Snake game like the one from the old Nokia phones

This is the first time I try to develope a code from scratch, and I did it with a simple, yet funny game. I'm very proud of it.

There are few things to note:
- Windows will see this exe as unrecognized the first time you run it. You can just run it anyway then Windows won't ask it anymore. There's no virus in this file, you can scan it with whichever antivirus you like to.
- If any bug happens, like snake not spawning, you can just restart the game by hitting space key and everything will work again.
- You move with arrow keys only.

Please report any bug so I can make this game better.
